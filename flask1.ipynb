    "'''Flask is a lightweight and micro web framework for Python. \n",
    "It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and highly extensible,\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some key advantages of Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: \n",
    "    Flask follows a minimalist design philosophy, \n",
    "providing only the essential tools for building web applications. \n",
    "This simplicity makes it easy for developers to get started quickly \n",
    "and understand the framework's core concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: \n",
    "   Flask is unopinionated and gives developers the freedom to \n",
    "choose the components they want to use. You can easily integrate various extensions\n",
    "and libraries as needed for your project, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask has a small codebase and minimal dependencies, resulting in a lightweight framework. This can lead to faster startup times and efficient resource usage, which is important for scaling web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 Templates: Flask comes with Jinja2 as its default templating engine. Jinja2 allows developers to create dynamic HTML templates with a familiar and easy-to-use syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Werkzeug: Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI library, which provides low-level web handling capabilities. This allows you to have fine-grained control over HTTP request and response handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions that can be easily integrated into your application. These extensions cover a wide range of functionalities, from database integration (e.g., SQLAlchemy) to authentication and authorization (e.g., Flask-Login and Flask-Security)."
